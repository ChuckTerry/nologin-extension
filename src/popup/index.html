            <p>To site owners:  This extension doesn't show the user any data that your server didn't send them in the first place.  I know back-end software engineers are expensive, but so is bandwidth nowadays.  Stop offsetting these costs to you users.  It makes for a poor UX and it likely means you're cutting the same corners on security.  Cutting costs is no excuse to compromise your users' privacy.</p>
